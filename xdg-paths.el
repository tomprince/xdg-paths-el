;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This package sets the directory according to the XDG Base
;;; Directory Specification.  The directories are given by the
;;; environment variables, falling back to the defaults enumerated
;;; in the standard.
;;;
;;; The $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR was not contemplated here, since we found
;;; no practical use for it.
;;;
;;; The defaults (or generated values) are:
;;;
;;;          Symbol                         Default
;;;  user-emacs-data-directory     ~/.local/share/emacs/
;;;  user-emacs-config-directory   ~/.config/emacs/
;;;  user-emacs-cache-directory    ~/.cache/emacs/
;;;  user-emacs-lisp-directory     `user-emacs-data-directory`/lisp
;;;  user-documents-directory      ~/Documents
;;;
;;; Some convenience functions are defined to locate files in these
;;; directories and to add user lisp to load-path.
;;;
;;; Some advantages are:
;;;
;;; Installation:
;;;
;;;   1. put xdg-paths in your own path.
;;;   2. Start your .emacs with (load-library 'xdg-paths) or,
;;;      write (load-library 'xdg-paths) in site-start.el
;;;
;;; Use cases:
;;;
;;; In my .emacs, I simply load a configuration hub file within
;;; user-emacs-config-directory with:
;;;
;;;   (load (locate-user-config-file "conf-init"))
;;;
;;; Within conf-init.el file, all other files are loaded with:
;;;
;;;   (dolist (module (list
;;;                    "edit" "frame" "programming" "tex" "xml"
;;;                    (concat "emacs-version-" (int-to-string emacs-major-version))
;;;                    (concat "window-system-" (symbol-name window-system))
;;;                    (concat "system-type-" (subst-char-in-string ?/ ?- (symbol-name system-type)))
;;;                    (concat "host-" (system-name))))
;;;     (load (locate-user-config-file (concat "conf-" module)) t))
;;;
;;; Adding to path from the user library just becomes:
;;;
;;;     (add-user-lisp-to-path "yasnippet")
;;;
;;; The user documents directory can be made the initial buffer in case
;;; no command line arguments are passed in:
;;;
;;;   (if (eql (length command-line-args) 1)
;;;      ;; No files were passed in the command line.
;;;      (setq initial-buffer-choice user-documents-directory))
;;;
;;;
;;; Caveat Emptor:
;;;
;;; Variable setting and directory initialization were not properly tested.
;;; I have never tested setting previously the directories because the
;;; default results are satisfactory.
;;;
;;;
;;; History:
;;;
;;;  0.1.2: Tom Prince <tom.prince@ualberta.net>
;;;    Require cl properly.
;;;    Fix some typos and dead code.
;;;  0.1.1: Francisco Miguel Colaço <francisco.col...@gmail.com>
;;;    Removed stale code;
;;;    Replaced eq by zerop in xdg-user-dir.
;;;  0.1: Francisco Miguel Colaço <francisco.col...@gmail.com>
;;;    Directory variables;
;;;    Functions to locate files;
;;;    add-to-path and add-user-lisp-to-path;
;;;    xdg-user-dir (depends on xdg-user-dir existing).
;;;
;;;
;;; Future work:
;;;
;;;   1. Make better docstrings (I may have assumed too much).
;;;   3. Add customize support.
;;;   3. Add more functions to cover the full standard.
;;;   4. Add more convenience functions (as needed by others).
;;;   5. Refactor the initialization of the variables.
;;;   6. Make it within the default emacs distribution.
;;;

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))

;;; Directories definition.
